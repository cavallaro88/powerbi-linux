# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — development

- Fedora-only CLI, RPM packaging and PBIX/PBIP/PBIR desktop integration.
- XDG state, private session broker, input verification and transactional repair/update/rollback.
- Production composition helper separated from UI diagnostics.
- Pinned Wine/DXVK sources and source-level secur32 correction.
- Unit tests, synthetic sales fixture, licensing and release documentation.
- Wine/DXVK runtime and RPM built; synthetic 158-table UI refresh and PBIP save/reopen checked in a disposable prepared prefix.
- Fixed WebView2 recipe, native stub signing and local feature-switch setup; browser-specific Wine version override fixes the clean-prefix GPU crash.
- Clean-prefix PBIX rendering and independent DAX total 300 verified; committed wineboot interruption/resume verified.
- CSV import harness and relational 158-table fixture added; the general source chooser blocks at the OneLake sign-in popup.
- Direct Text/CSV import, numeric visual creation, Unicode save/reopen and production desktop PBIX/PBIP/PBIR dispatch verified in the clean prefix.
- Native repair/update/rollback and preserving uninstall verified; uninstall clears automatic association tokens and masks an installed system RPM entry for the user.
- Graceful broker shutdown, Unicode native probes, memory-profile CLI and periodic UI/heap/GPU monitoring added.
- Wine's automatic desktop exports disabled; legacy launchers pointing into managed snapshots cleaned without removing foreign-prefix handlers.

This is a validated development preview for the documented synthetic workloads. The two-hour session passed with 24 visual checks and no OOM/GPU replacement. Native refresh/Save/reopen, final normal-profile desktop dispatch and legacy-handler migration were checked. One discrepant idle native capture is retained, with cause not established. The general OneLake source chooser and Microsoft sign-in remain limited.
